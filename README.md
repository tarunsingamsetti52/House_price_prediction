# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in Delhi using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses in Delhi, including the area name, area in square feet, number of bathrooms, and the number of bedrooms (BHK - Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen). By analyzing this data and building a machine learning model, we can make accurate predictions on the cost of a house given the input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is called "Delhi House Price Dataset," which contains the following columns:

- **Area Name**: The name of the area or locality where the house is located.
- **Area in sqft**: The total area of the house in square feet.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: The count of bathrooms available in the house.
- **BHK**: The count of bedrooms (Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen).

The dataset is available in a CSV format (Comma-Separated Values) and will be used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Dependencies

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the project)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **data**: This folder contains the dataset file "delhi_house_data.csv."
2. **House_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: This is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook "House_Price_Prediction.ipynb" using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code step by step.

## Data Preprocessing

In the Jupyter Notebook, we will perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features (if any), splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and scaling numerical features (if required).

## Model Building

We will explore different machine learning algorithms to build our house price prediction model. Some of the algorithms we may consider are:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

We will evaluate each model's performance using appropriate metrics and select the one with the best performance.

## Prediction

Once the model is trained and evaluated, we can use it to make predictions on new data. To predict the cost of a house, provide the following input:

- Area Name
- Area in sqft
- Number of Bathrooms
- BHK

The model will output the predicted house price based on these input features.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we will have a machine learning model capable of predicting house prices in Delhi based on area name, area in square feet, number of bathrooms, and BHK. This model can be further used for real estate applications, investment decisions, and other related purposes.
